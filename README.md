  <br>
  
You are designing an automated security system for a room where we will be storing an artifact sensitive to low temperatures. You need to design a system that has the following features:

1. Look for foreign bodies and objects in vicinity of the sensor and flag it as "Intruders"

2. Monitor temperature, and let a LED glow if the temperature drops too low to indicate room heating

3. Buzzer + alarm LED to indicate presence of Intruders.

4. Gas sensors to detect smoke and check if the room is being sabotaged.

5. LCD display showing the status of the room. It has 3 statuses: "Safe", "Compromised", and "heating room".
